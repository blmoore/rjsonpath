\title{rjsonpath: JSONPath queries for R}
\description{
The **rjsonpath** package provides an implementation of the
JSONPath query language for R. JSONPath is an XPath-like syntax
for selecting elements from JSON data structures.
}
\details{
The main entry point is [json_path()], which evaluates a JSONPath
expression against a JSON object read with [read_json()]. It
supports common JSONPath features, including:

- **Property access** via `$.prop` and nested properties
- **Array indices and slices** such as `$.items[0]`, `$.items[1:3]`
- **Wildcards** (`*`) for properties and array elements
- **Recursive descent** using `..`
- **Filters** with `?()` expressions, e.g. `?(@.price < 10)`
- **Length‑based expressions** like `(@.length-1)`
}
\section{Workflow}{

Typical usage is:

1. Read JSON from a file or connection with [read_json()].
2. Apply a JSONPath query with [json_path()] to select elements.
3. Optionally set `simplify = TRUE` to coerce simple list results
   to atomic vectors.
}

\section{Strict vs. lenient paths}{

By default, [json_path()] requires paths to start with `"$"` and
treats numeric indices as zero-based (JSON-style). You can relax
these behaviours using the `strict` and `zero_index` arguments.
